<div class="recname">Chili Verde</div><br /><div class="recipe"> 3-4 pounds chicken breasts or good quality pork roast (preferably with bone) <br /> 6 Anaheim (mild) peppers <br /> 3 Jalapeno (medium) peppers <br /> 1 medium onion (optional--more pepper flavor without) <br /> 2 cloves garlic <br /> 1 tablespoon cumin <br /> 2 cups chicken stock (or 2 cubes chicken bouillon and 2 cups water) <br /> 2 tablespoons flour <br /> Salt to taste <br /> 1-2 tablespoons sugar<br /><br /> Put chicken or pork in crock pot.  Remove seeds from peppers (remember to wear gloves!) and add to pot.  Add onion, garlic, cumin, and then pour broth over all.  Cook for at least 5 hours on low (preferred) or 3 on high.  Remove meat from pot, de-bone and cut (or pull) into bite-size pieces.  Meanwhile, liquefy the remaining ingredients and add flour to thicken (I prefer to not bother chopping anything too much and just liquefy it all, which makes a thick green soup.  If you don't have children who are squeamish about onions or peppers, you could just chop everything fine and leave it as is).  Return meat to pot.  Salt to taste.<br /> Use sugar to adjust heat--adding more sugar will take the edge off any heat (really, it's amazing).  You can also adjust the heat by varying the ratio of Anaheims to Jalapenos, or substituting bell or hotter peppers. </div>
