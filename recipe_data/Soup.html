<div id="content"><div class="recname">French Onion</div><br /><div class="recipe"> 2 cans (14 1/2 oz.) beef broth<br /> 1 can (14 1/2 oz.) fat free chicken broth<br /> 1/4 cup white grape juice<br /> 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce<br /> 1 garlic clove<br /> 1/4 teaspoon dried thyme<br /> 2 cups caramelized onions with juice (see below)<br /><br /> Put all ingredients except onions into a 4 1/2-quart Dutch oven or soup pot.  Stir and heat over high heat until boiling.  Add onions.  Cover, reduce heat to medium, and boil for 1 minute.
Divide soup into 4 ovenproof bowls.  Put slice of bread in each bowl, layer with slice of Swiss cheese and sprinkle with 1-teaspoon Parmesan cheese.  Place under broiler for 1 minute or until cheese melts.  Serve at once.<br /><br /> <b>Caramelized Onions</b><br /> Place 6 sliced onions in slow cooker.  Drizzle with olive oil and (optionally) sprinkle with brown sugar.  Cook on low heat for 8 to 10 hours.  Left over onions can be refrigerated and used later. </div>

<div class="recname">Ham and White Bean</div><br /><div class="recipe"> 2 cups white beans<br /> 1 ham bone<br /> &frac12; small onion chopped<br /> 1 carrot grated<br /> 2 medium potatoes diced<br /> Salt and pepper<br /><br /> Soak beans overnight, if needed, then drain water.  Put beans, ham bone, and onion in crock pot.  Add 6 cups water (about triple the volume of the beans, enough to cover the ham bone) and cook on low for 4 hours.  Pull ham off bone and add additional ham pieces if desired.  Add carrot and potatoes, continue to cook for a couple of hours longer.  Salt and pepper to taste.  
Cooks note: last time I made this, we used a ham that came with a sugary glaze.  I added some of glazed edge of the ham and some of the gelatinous drippings and it came out good.  Try not to get it too sweet.  Also note you could leave this cooking all day at work, microwave the potatoes and onions and toss them in at the end. </div>
