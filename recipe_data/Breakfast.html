<div class="recname">Scones: Cranberry and White Chocolate English Scones</div><br /><div class="recipe"> 1&frac34; cups all-purpose flour<br /> 2 teaspoons baking powder<br /> &frac12; teaspoon salt<br /> 1 tablespoon white sugar<br /> 8 tablespoons unsalted butter (chilled, cut in 1/3-inch cubes)<br /> &frac12; cup dried cranberries<br /> &frac12; cup white chocolate baking chips<br /> 2/3 cup + 2 tablespoons buttermilk<br /> 2 tablespoons granulated white sugar<br /><br /> Heat oven to 400&ordm;.  Combine flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar with an electric mixer.  Using the paddle attachment, add the butter and mix just until coated with flour (the butter chunks should remain fairly large--no less than half their original size).  Add the dried cranberries and white chocolate chips.  Stir gently. With the mixer set on a slow speed, add 2/3 cup of the buttermilk (save the rest to brush tops of scones) and mix until just absorbed.  Stop mixing when the dough begins to pull away from the sides of the bowl.  Scrape the dough from the bowl and shape it into a ball.  With well-floured fingers, pat the dough into a 7-inch diameter circle.  Cut the circle into quarters and then again into eights.  Place the scones on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and brush tops with the remaining buttermilk.  Sprinkle with sugar.  Bake until well-browned, about 15-20 minutes. </div>

<div class="recname">Ugnspannkaka (Swedish Oven Pancakes)</div><br /><div class="recipe"> 3 eggs<br /> &frac34; cup milk<br /> &frac34; cup flour<br /> 1&frac12; tablespoons unsalted butter<br /> 1 teaspoon sugar<br /> 1/8 teaspoon nutmeg<br /> Pinch salt<br /> 1 teaspoon light vegetable oil, like canola<br /> 1 apple, peeled, cored and sliced thin<br /> 1 tablespoon brown sugar<br /> Powdered sugar for dusting<br /> Prepared lingonberries<br /><br /> Beat together all ingredients except oil, apple, two sugars and lingonberries.

Heat oil in a 9- or 10-inch cast-iron skillet on stove top, swirling so sides are covered. Add apples and brown sugar. Pour in batter, and place pan in oven.

Serve with lingonberries, but omit the sugar dusting. </div>

Cover with plastic wrap and set aside overnight at room temperature.<br /> Brush waffle iron lightly with oil and pre-heat.  Separate the eggs and stir the yolks into the batter.  Beat the whites until they hold soft peaks.  Stir them gently into the batter.  Spread batter on waffle iron and bake.  Serve immediately, or keep warm in low oven.
