<div class="recname">Pecan (Grandma Armstrong)</div><br /><div class="recipe"> 1 cup brown sugar<br /> 4 tablespoons butter<br /> &frac14; teaspoon salt<br /> 1 unbaked pie shell<br /> 1 cup light corn Karo<br /> 3 eggs<br /> 1 cup pecans<br /> 1 teaspoon vanilla<br /><br /> Cream butter, add sugar and syrup, still creaming.

Bake at 350 degrees for 50 minutes.<br /> (Bill&rsquo;s note: This is a little too sticky for my taste.  To reduce that, I decreased Karo to &frac34; cup and added &frac14; cup white sugar and 2 tablespoons of flour.  Also I roast the nuts slightly under the broiler to bring out the flavor.  And note that you can&rsquo;t have too many nuts&mdash;I&rsquo;d increase it by half!)
